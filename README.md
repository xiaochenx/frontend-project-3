# frontend-project-3

Project Overview

The idea of this app is to allow people to keep track of meaningful and useful gift ideas they have for their loved ones, so they don't just pick up some useless tchotchkes in a gas station on the big day.

How to use

1. First go to "https://github.com/xiaochenx/backend-project-3" download the backend of this app, and follow instructions there to start the backend server properly.

2. Fork and clone this frontend repo to your local environment, cd into "gift_tracker" folder, then run "npm install", "npm install react_router-dom", and finally "npm start" to load up the react frontend in your browser.
3. Feel free to explore!

Thank you!
